# Repository Naming Convention for Daytona Experiments

Welcome to the "Daytona Experiments" GitHub organization! We use a consistent naming convention for our repositories to ensure clarity, consistency, and ease of management. All repositories should follow the specified naming scheme detailed below.

## Naming Scheme

**Format**: `exp-[color]-[year]`

### Components:
- **exp**: A constant prefix indicating that this is part of the experiments.
- **[color]**: A codename based on a color.
- **[year]**: The year when the experiment starts.

### Example Codenames:
You can select a codename from a wide range of colors. Here are some suggestions:
- Primary Colors: `red`, `blue`, `green`
- Secondary Colors: `orange`, `purple`, `yellow`
- Unique Shades: `crimson`, `emerald`, `sapphire`, `magenta`, `azure`, `teal`

### Examples:

1. **exp-red-2024**
   - **exp**: Constant prefix.
   - **red**: Color codename.
   - **072024**: The month the experiment ends.

2. **exp-crimson-2024**
   - **exp**: Constant prefix.
   - **crimson**: Color codename.
   - **072024**: The month the experiment ends.

3. **exp-teal-2024**

### Steps to Create a New Repository:

1. Choose a color codename for your experiment.
2. Ensure the name is unique within the organization to avoid conflicts.
3. Use the format `exp-[color]-[year]` to name your repository.
4. Create your repository under the GitHub organization with the agreed naming convention.

### Additional Tips:

- **Clarity**: Make sure the codename is easily recognizable and not overly complex.
- **Consistency**: Stick to the naming convention strictly to maintain organization-wide uniformity.
- **Documentation**: Each repository should include detailed README files explaining the purpose and scope of the experiment.

By following this naming convention, we ensure that all repositories are easy to navigate, access, and manage. Thank you for your cooperation!
