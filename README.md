# Repository Naming Convention for Daytona Experiments

Welcome to the "Daytona Experiments" GitHub organization! We use a consistent naming convention for our repositories to ensure clarity, consistency, and ease of management. All repositories should follow the specified naming scheme detailed below.

## Naming Scheme

**Format**: `exp-[yearmonth]-[color]`

### Components:
- **exp**: A constant prefix indicating that this is part of the experiments.
- **[yearmonth]**: The anticipated end date of the experiment in the format `YYYYMM` (e.g., 202408 for August 2024).
- **[color]**: A codename based on a color.

### Example Codenames:
You can select a codename from a wide range of colors. Here are some suggestions:
- Primary Colors: `red`, `blue`, `green`
- Secondary Colors: `orange`, `purple`, `yellow`
- Unique Shades: `crimson`, `emerald`, `sapphire`, `magenta`, `azure`, `teal`

### Examples:

### Steps to Create a New Repository:

4. Create your repository under the GitHub organization with the agreed naming convention.

### Additional Tips:
